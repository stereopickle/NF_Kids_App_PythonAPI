## Text Log Classifier Model
There are many different ways NF1 symptoms may develop into further problems. 
We intend to build a multi-label classifier that shows the probability of each known complication, so the parents and guardians of children can be informed when observing the child with NF1.
This model will be initially trained on various descriptions of symptoms and their labels collected from various online resources.
Each time a user inputs any new diagnosis, the model will be retrained based on their past log and new label.
Each time a user logs a text description, the model will return the probability of each complication based on that description.
